# Alpine VPN Framework (AVF)

<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mjwhitta">üç™ Buy me a cookie</a>

This tool will (hopefully) make it trivial to setup an Alpine Linux
box as a VPN box. It only supports OpenVPN (with optional obfsproxy)
and Wireguard at this point in time.

## Setup

All below steps assume you are `root`.

1. Install Alpine

2. Install bash and git

```
$ apk add bash git
```

3. Clone AVF

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/mjwhitta/avf.git
$ cd ./avf
```

4. Run `prep` to install dependencies (optionally obfsproxy support)

```
$ ./prep [--obfs]
```

5. Install `avf` and read usage to follow the remaining setup

```
$ ./installer
$ avf -h
```

**Note:** Ensure that `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`.
